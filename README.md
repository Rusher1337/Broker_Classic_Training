# Broker Classic Training

Project Status: Development

This is an LDB (Lib Data Broker) plugin that provides a list of learnable spells for your class, now you don't need to visit your trainer to actually see if you have a new spell to pick up or not!

# Feedback / Issues

Currently spell listing might not be 100% accurate, if you find a spell thats missing or mis-categorised etc please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/ps-wow/Broker_Classic_Training/issues)
