# Broker Classic Training

Project Status: Development

This is an LDB (Lib Data Broker) plugin that provides a list of learnable spells for your class, now you don't need to visit your trainer to actually see if you have a new spell to pick up or not!

Additionally the addon also has a database of the various Tomes for a given class and will list these also.

# Buy me a coffee

Coffee is the fuel of development, buying me a coffee gives me the energy I need to create, update and maintain addons, I do it for fun, but it's always nice to get a little something in return.  Use any of the sites below if you care to say thanks
